# Streamlit Markdown Viewer

## Overview

The Streamlit Markdown Viewer is a simple application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload and view Markdown files (`README.md` or any other Markdown files) in a rendered format. It is particularly useful for previewing Markdown content in a user-friendly way.

## Features

- **Upload Markdown Files**: Easily upload `.md` files to be rendered.
- **Render Markdown**: View the content of the uploaded Markdown files as formatted text.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
- **Streamlit**: The application relies on Streamlit for rendering the Markdown content.

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install Streamlit using pip:

## Usage

   ```

2. **Access the App**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. **Upload a Markdown File**:

   - Use the "Upload a README.md file" button to select and upload your Markdown file.
   - The content of the Markdown file will be displayed in the app as rendered Markdown.
