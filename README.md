# Streamlit Markdown Viewer

## Overview

The Streamlit Markdown Viewer is a simple application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload and view Markdown files (`README.md` or any other Markdown files) in a rendered format. It is particularly useful for previewing Markdown content in a user-friendly way.

## Features

- **Upload Markdown Files**: Easily upload `.md` files to be rendered.
- **Render Markdown**: View the content of the uploaded Markdown files as formatted text.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
- **Streamlit**: The application relies on Streamlit for rendering the Markdown content.
